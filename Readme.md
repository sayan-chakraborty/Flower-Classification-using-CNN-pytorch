<h1> Readme </h1>

This is a mini-project wherein I learned how to use gpu's and ImageFolder class for image classification task. I have also described the function
of each and every class in the PyTorch library. Any beginner will highly benefit from this as he will be able to make sense of what is 
actually happening. 
If you are new to PyTorch, then you can refer this.
